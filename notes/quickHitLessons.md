# Getting up to Speed Quickly with Digital Credentials Quickly

## The *Bite Sized* World of Digital Credentials 

### Verifiable Credentials

#### ***Verifiable:***

*"Verifiability of a credential **does not imply the truth of claims encoded**
therein. Rather, **once the authenticity and currency of a verifiable credential
or verifiable presentation are established, a verifier validates the included
claims using their own business rules before relying on them**. Such reliance only
occurs after evaluating the issuer, the proof, the subject, and the claims,
against one or more verifier policies."*[^1]
